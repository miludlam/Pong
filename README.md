# Pong
This simple version of Pong is an intro project into using C++ for game development.
## SDL
The project uses the [SDL2 library](https://www.libsdl.org/) for I/O handling.
## Objects
This project does not use separate classes to represent paddles, balls, walls, but uses
a Game class and member variables for element tracking.
